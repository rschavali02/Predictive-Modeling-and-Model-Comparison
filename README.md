# Predictive-Modeling-and-Model-Comparison

The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in Melbourne using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

Our goal will be to use this dataset to gain some insight about characteristics of different features.
We will be using data profiling from pandas and create models (hopefully more than 3) and compare them to find out which model performed the best and probably explain why it is the best model among all in this data.


## Comparison

In this project I compare Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models on this data
